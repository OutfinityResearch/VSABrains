## Remaining Work

### Multi-Column Consensus (Exp1)
- Add a true multi-column partial-observability path (per-column inputs) to measure consensus gain (DS003 Exp1).
- Demonstrate consensus accuracy exceeding the best single column by >5%.

### Exp2 Quality Targets
- Improve coreference accuracy and motif handling to meet DS003 targets (currently below thresholds).

### Compression Semantics
- Replace proxy compression sweep with a real summary-compression mechanism tied to slow-map summaries.
