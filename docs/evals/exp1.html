  <h2>Experiment 1: Reference-Frame Alignment</h2>
  <p>
    Goal: show that multiple columns with different offsets can still agree on the same latent
    situation. The key signal is that consensus should outperform any single column under ambiguity
    and noise.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Plain-language version: several small “witnesses” see the same story with different noise.
    We want the group vote to be more reliable than any single witness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alignment means that even if columns start in different places, they can still agree
    on which location best matches the query window.
  </p>

  <h3>How this experiment works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate a synthetic story with known locations.</li>
    <li>Give each column a slightly different noisy view of the same window.</li>
    <li>Ask “where is the window?” and compare single-column vs consensus.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to read the metrics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Loc@1</strong> = top-1 accuracy (best guess is correct).</li>
    <li><strong>Loc@5</strong> = top-5 accuracy (correct location is in the top 5).</li>
    <li><strong>Consensus Gain</strong> = how much better the vote is vs one column.</li>
  </ul>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Target</th>
        <th>Status</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Loc@1 (clean)</td><td>1.00</td><td>&gt; 0.85</td><td><span class="status-pill status-pass">Pass</span></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Loc@5 (clean)</td><td>1.00</td><td>&gt; 0.95</td><td><span class="status-pill status-pass">Pass</span></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Consensus Gain</td><td>0.103</td><td>&gt; 0.05</td><td><span class="status-pill status-pass">Pass</span></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Noise Robustness (10%)</td><td>1.00</td><td>&gt; 0.90</td><td><span class="status-pill status-pass">Pass</span></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Ambiguous Disambiguation</td><td>1.00</td><td>&gt; 0.70</td><td><span class="status-pill status-pass">Pass</span></td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Why this matters</h3>
  <p>
    If alignment fails, the architecture is unreliable under noise. Passing here is the
    minimum proof that “many small columns” is not just extra compute—it is extra robustness.
