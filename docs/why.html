          <h1>Why VSABrains?</h1>
          <p>
            VSABrains is built to make temporal order auditable and robust under noise.
            It encodes order as spatial address (trajectories in discrete maps), then uses
            multi-column consensus to reduce ambiguity. This page answers common questions
            and clarifies what the architecture does and does not claim.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Is this still VSA? Is there holography?</h2>
          <p>
            It is <strong>inspired</strong> by VSA ideas (symbol composition, binding, and distributed
            representations) but it is not a holographic VSA system. VSABrains does not rely on
            dense superposition to represent long sequences. Instead, it uses discrete maps and
            heavy-hitters to keep top-K tokens per cell, which is sparse and auditable.
          </p>
          <p>
            So: <strong>no holography claim</strong>. The architecture is a different tradeoff:
            discrete, CPU-friendly, and traceable, even if it sacrifices some of the
            smooth algebra of classic VSA.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Is the meaning of a story its final point?</h2>
          <p>
            No. The final location is not the “meaning.” It is just the end of a trajectory.
            The point of VSABrains is that the <strong>path</strong> is written into memory as a sequence
            of locations. Meaning comes from replay and evidence chains, not from a single endpoint.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Can we reconstruct the path from the final point?</h2>
          <p>
            Not from the final point alone. A single endpoint does not encode the full path.
            Path reconstruction is done through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Replay</strong> from checkpoints and the episodic store.</li>
            <li><strong>Localization</strong> using recent token windows (fast maps + location index).</li>
            <li><strong>Slow maps</strong> as coarse summaries for long horizons (approximate).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is a deliberate design: store enough structure to replay deterministically,
            and avoid pretending that a final point contains all history.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Can we compress columns and still reconstruct paths?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, but only approximately. The system already supports compression via
            <strong>checkpointing</strong> (store partial state) and <strong>slow-map summaries</strong>
            (store coarse tokens for older history). This enables approximate reconstruction
            without retaining every detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            If perfect replay is required, you must keep the full episodic stream. If
            approximate replay is acceptable, checkpoints + slow maps can reduce storage
            at the cost of fidelity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Why not just keep a list of events?</h2>
          <p>
            A pure list is strong for small data, but it has tradeoffs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> retrieval is linear unless you build separate indexes.</li>
            <li><strong>Noise:</strong> a single stream offers no multi-view consensus.</li>
            <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> a list has no native mechanism to maintain parallel hypotheses.</li>
            <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> you still need explicit checks for conflicts, otherwise
              you return inconsistent answers without warning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            VSABrains makes these behaviors explicit: spatial indexing for fast localization,
            multi-column consensus for robustness, and replay + verifiers for auditable answers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Where is the evidence?</h2>
          <p>
            See Experiment 4 in <code>eval/exp4-consensus</code>. It compares a single noisy stream
            and a naive list-scan baseline against multi-column consensus under the same noise rate.
            Consensus should yield higher accuracy and lower disagreement, while the list baseline
            shows the cost of linear scanning.
